The lesson progression
Massive 38,000 word sequenced text resource
At the heart of Typing Tournament Online is a vast bank of carefully controlled, precisely Sequenced Text Resources that have been designed to reinforce the learning of the key strokes, build muscle memory and engage the learner.
They have been intentionally created to motivate learners of all ages by engaging them through the educative content that is full of interesting facts and peppered with humour.

Separate US and British English variants
There are separate versions of the Sequenced Text Resource for British and American English that address conventions such as spelling exemplified by “color’ and “colour” and cultural issues such as the non use of “ass” in the home row exercise in the US version. The exercise content will be determined for you when you nominate your country.

Lesson Scope and Sequence
The content of Typing Tournament Online draws from the Sequenced Text Resource and is divided into 16 Levels, with accompanying Drills, Games and Tests.
Each Level introduces a new set of Focus Keys. An animated demonstration of the location and fingering of the new keys is followed by an interactive exercise.
Level Exercises use only the Focus Keys, while Drills, Games and Tests, though prioritising the Focus Keys, integrate them with previously learned material in realistic text-type environments.

Anaconda is a free and open-source[5] distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda.[6] The Anaconda distribution is used by over 6 million users and includes more than 1400 popular data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.[5]

Overview
Anaconda distribution comes with more than 1,400 packages as well as the Conda package and virtual environment manager, called Anaconda Navigator [7], so it eliminates the need to learn to install each library independently.

The open source packages can be individually installed from the Anaconda repository [8] with the conda install command or using the pip install command that is installed with Anaconda. Pip packages provide many of the features of conda packages and in most cases they can work together.

Custom packages can be made using the conda build command, and can be shared with others by uploading them to Anaconda Cloud,[9] PyPI or other repositories.

The default installation of Anaconda2 includes Python 2.7 and Anaconda3 includes Python 3.7. However, you can create new environments that include any version of Python packaged with conda [10].
